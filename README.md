Over a year I created a fully playable multiplayer survival game in the unity engine. I programmed from scratch all game systems such as player movement, interaction etc. The project uses the Fishnet Library for networking and has steamworks integration. 

## Phyics Based Xr Interaction Framework
[Repository link](https://github.com/cread134/Physics-Based-Xr-Interaction)

I created a custom framwork for xr interactions in the unity engine. The interactions, unlike most preexisting packages are completely physics based and as such faciliates realistic reactions with the world.
