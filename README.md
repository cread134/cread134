# PDT - Playermakers Dev team 2023

This project is to make a game as a team for university. The team is made of 20 developers, from artists to programmers. I was lead programmer and also did art and animation. The game has been released on steam and itch.io

# Projects
## Realtime multiplayer game
[Repository link](https://github.com/cread134/Unity-mutiplayer-survival-game)

Over a year I created a fully playable multiplayer survival game in the unity engine. I programmed from scratch all game systems such as player movement, interaction etc. The project uses the Fishnet Library for networking and has steamworks integration.
