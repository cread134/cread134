# Console UI Framework
For an assignment we had to create a console app to manage a hospital.
To do this assignment I wrote a framework for reactive, ui with a fluent api which follows an MVC structure.

In short you can author ui in like so,
```
public class DoctorAppointmentsView : View
{
	public override void BuildView(ViewBuilder viewBuilder)
	{
		viewBuilder
			.AddControl(new PageHeader("DOTNET Hospital Management System", "All Appointments"))
			.AddControl(new OutputBox(string.Empty, "doctor-appointments-outputBox") { Enabled = false })
			.AddControl(new TableView<AppointmentModel>("All Appointments",
				new TableViewColumn<AppointmentModel>(x => x.APT_Doctor.DCT_User.USR_FullName, overrideName: "Doctor"),
				new TableViewColumn<AppointmentModel>(x => x.APT_Patient.PAT_User.USR_FullName, overrideName: "Patient"),
				new TableViewColumn<AppointmentModel>(x => x.APT_Description),
				new TableViewColumn<AppointmentModel>(x => x.APT_AppointmentTime, overrideName: "Appointment Time")));
	}
}

```

This project is to make a game as a team for university. The team is made of 20 developers, from artists to programmers. I was lead programmer and also did art and animation. The game has been released on steam and itch.io

# Realtime XR projects
I have been experimenting with creating custom frameworks for naturalistic and immersive interaction in XR environments.

Initially I create this project.

## Realtime multiplayer game
[Repository link](https://github.com/cread134/Unity-mutiplayer-survival-game)

Over a year I created a fully playable multiplayer survival game in the unity engine. I programmed from scratch all game systems such as player movement, interaction etc. The project uses the Fishnet Library for networking and has steamworks integration.
