Over a year I created a fully playable multiplayer survival game in the unity engine. I programmed from scratch all game systems such as player movement, interaction etc. The project uses the Fishnet Library for networking and has steamworks integration. 

# PDT - Playermakers Dev team 2023

This project is to make a game as a team for university. The team is made of 20 developers, from artists to programmers. I was lead programmer and also did art and animation. 

## Phyics Based Xr Interaction Framework
[Repository link](https://github.com/cread134/Physics-Based-Xr-Interaction)

I created a custom framwork for xr interactions in the unity engine. The interactions, unlike most preexisting packages are completely physics based and as such faciliates realistic reactions with the world.
